# NodeKeyboardWeb #

This is the webpage part of my NodeKeyboard app, a project that joins _Raspberry Pi_, _Makey makey_ and _Node_ in one and awesome project! 

## Getting started ##

This is a part of a full project so you will need to download the other parts in:
  
[NodeKeyboardServer, the node server (with sockets and moongose!)](https://github.com/LudoBermejo/NodeKeyboardSERVER)
[NodeKeyboardAPP, the node app (sockets and makeymakey for the win!)](https://github.com/LudoBermejo/NodeKeyboardAPP)

Then you must change the server (http://ludobermejo.es:9100) for the location you will run NodeKeyboardServer.

And that's all

#### How to work

It's easy. You go to the page keyboard.html, then you can start using your raspberry and makey makey to make magic.

Ah! And you can add new questions by using questions.html
